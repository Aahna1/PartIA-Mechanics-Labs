        "1. To learn about the operation and limitations of sensors for measuring acceleration, angular velocity, and wheel rotation angle.\n",
        "2. To assess the suitability of individual sensors and combinations of sensors for determining the motion of a vehicle.\n",

        "- Many modern powered road vehicles (cars, motorbikes, trucks) are equipped with sensors to measure the motion of the vehicle.\n",
        "- The measured data can be used to actively control the vehicle (via its engine, brakes, suspension and steering) to improve stability, increase comfort, or provide autonomy.\n",
        "- In this experiment the focus is on measuring the motion of a car travelling in a horizontal plane.\n",
        "- The theory of particle kinematics that you learnt last term will be relevant.\n",
        "- Remember that the kinematics of a particle can be expressed in cartesian, polar or intrinsic coordinates.\n",
        "- In this experiment, intrinsic coordinates will be the most appropriate, see extract from Mechanics Data Book in Figure 1.\n",
        "- Intrinsic coordinates involve describing the motion of a particle (or car in this case) using the speed along the path and the direction (angle) of the path.\n",
        "- Note that the speed of the particle perpendicular to the path is always zero, although the acceleration perpendicular to the path may not be zero.\n",
